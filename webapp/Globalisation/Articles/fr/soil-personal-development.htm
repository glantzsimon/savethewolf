    Number two soils are so focussed on supporting and helping others than they may not take enough time out for themselves. 
    As such, they may be prone to getting a bit worn out. They should be encouraged to get a healthy balance between work and play and sometimes put themselves first.

    It is also very important for soil energies not to stagnate. Frequent walks and exercise are very good for this reason.
