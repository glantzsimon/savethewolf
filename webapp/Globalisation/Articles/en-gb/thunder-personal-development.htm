    Thunder energies benefit greatly from taking time to reflect and take stock. They should also endeavour to see projects through to completion.

    Socially, thunder energies derive a lot of benefit from focussing more on listening to others. In addition, it is good to remember that the positive and energetic nature of
    thunder may be overbearing and intimitading to some.

    It is important for thunder energies to build up their energy reserves with sufficient sleep, rest and good nutrition, so as to have enough energy to support them through 
    their frequent bursts of energy and action.
