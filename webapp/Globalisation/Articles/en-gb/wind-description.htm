    Like thunder energies, also of the element wood, wind energies can be impulsive at times. However, they typically have a gentler, steadier nature than three wood energies.
    Similarly, they are generally a lot more reliable and thoughtful than three energies. They are practical and possess much common sense as well as sensitivity to others.

    The sensitivity and receptiveness to others displayed by wind energies can make them great counsellors. On the other hand, these energies can also be gullible and easily influenced by or overly trusting of others.
    It may be wise for four energies to seek the council of others before making a long-term commitment to a project or relationship.

    Being highly sensitive also means that wind energies are greatly appreciative music, literature and the arts.

    It is important for wind energies to communicate and they enjoy deep conversation and the exchange of ideas. They can also be excellent speakers possessing great charisma and a strong ability to influence others.
